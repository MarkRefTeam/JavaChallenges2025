     * How should we start? Yes, Maven!
     * Just hit the ctrl+alt+shift+S combination ,choose the libraries and " + " sign!
     * Here is the import command to you! Use this one "//org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.8.1"

     * Next step! Call this import in manually : "import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;"
     * for assertEquals test option!
