     * Well we're starting the Convert Number to the word!
     * Well it's absolutely a new lessen , so ...How should we start?
     * In a first step we re-watched the last lesson for instruction!
     * Well I create the triple static array with numbers(words)!
     * After I need use the TDD(Test Driven Development) build, it will be so interest because
     * that the first time when I'm doing this!
     * <p>
     * How its work and what is this? After if im finish the static field the next step is open a new src
     * with Test phase! In a first try it will be False ,because I couldn't call a method for it!
     * So I must! Let's go and we will see what's happen!

        /** Okay that homework was so crazy! Well I think im understand but need more practice!
         * let's talk about something's!
         * 1. Convert : The convert(int num) method is responsible for transforming a number into words.
         * For example: convert(99) → Ninety-Nine.
         * It is the main logic of your program that executes the entire conversion.
         * It also uses recursive calls (calls itself) to handle larger numbers efficiently.
         * - We used it because our goal was to convert numbers into words.
         * - It makes the code cleaner and reusable.
         * I think I can understand it !!! Thank you!!!
         * <p>
         * 2.The trim() method is a String function that removes unnecessary spaces from the beginning and end of a text.
         * We used it because during number conversion, extra spaces can appear.
         * It ensures that the output is formatted correctly and clean.
         * I don't understand clearly , we should talk about them!
         * <p>
         * 3. The Math.log10(num) method calculates the base-10 logarithm of a number.
         * It tells us how many tens make up the number.
         * Examples :
         * Math.log10(10) = 1 → 10 is 10¹
         * Math.log10(100) = 2 → 100 is 10²
         * Math.log10(1000) = 3 → 1000 is 10³
         * We used it to determine how many digits the number has.
         * The expression thousands[(int) Math.log10(num) / 3] helps us decide if we should use "A Thousand", "A Million", or "A Billion".
         * That was the most confused part to me! I can learn it but need more task for this!
         * <p>
         * I did alone the static field,test phase and called the method for 1-999, after I used the AI for last step!
