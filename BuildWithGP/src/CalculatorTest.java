 * Well we're doing the test phase for Calculator for practice
 * I don't have extra idea yet just try it!
 * Okey , in first step just click in Project structure and push the "Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S" combination!
 * After just choose the libraries and click the " + " signal and select the "Maven"
 * If you did well the next step is the refresh program!
 * How can you do this? Just going File-> Invalidate Caches!!!After the program will suggest a restart!(recommended)
 * If you didn't burn out just write a @Test and choose the first command!It will be the org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;!
 * Congratulation your Test import was success!
