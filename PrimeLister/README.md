# 📐 PrimeLister Project

## 🛠️ Project Structure and Approach

I started this project by creating a **Maven-based Java application**, using a `pom.xml` file to define project dependencies and structure.

As part of the initial setup, I added **JUnit 5** to the project’s dependencies to enable unit testing.

### 📁 Project Structure

- `PrimeLister.java`: contains the logic to check whether a number is prime.
- `SquareNumberLister.java`: generates perfect squares up to a given limit.
- `App.java`: formats and displays the results in a readable format.
- `AppTest.java`, `PrimeListerTest.java`, `SquareNumberListerTest.java`: JUnit test classes under the `test` source folder.

### 🔁 Development Methodology

This project was built using the **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** methodology.

1. First, I wrote test cases for the expected behavior.
2. Then I implemented methods to fulfill the tests.
3. I iterated between writing tests and refining the logic until all test cases passed.

This approach helped ensure a clean, modular, and well-tested solution.

✅ All tests passed successfully, and the application works as intended.

### Bonus Joke 🤓

Why was 4 sad at the math party?

Because it thought it was *prime*… but everyone knew it was just being square. 😅

("That was a very interesting story — I’ll tell you later!")
